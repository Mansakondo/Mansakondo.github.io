## Rails Developer / Ruby Programmer

### I've work on...
* A [PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43399) (extracted from a [gem](https://github.com/mansakondo/activemodel-embedding)) to model semi-structured data in Rails applications.
* A [software](http://karan-demo.herokuapp.com/) for indexing and faceting [encoded bibliographic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_standards).
* This [project](https://rest-countries-challenge.herokuapp.com/) which was a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca), to learn Tailwind and sharpen my front-end skills.

### I'm familiar with...
* Modeling and processing semi-structured data in Rails.
* TailwindCSS, Stimulus, Elasticsearch, Docker

### I enjoy...
* Designing domain models.
* Writing code that reads well.
