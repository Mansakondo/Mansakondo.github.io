## Rails Developer / Ruby Programmer

### I've worked on...
* A [PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43399) (extracted from a [gem](https://github.com/mansakondo/activemodel-embedding)) to model semi-structured data in Rails applications.
* An [application](https://karan-demo.herokuapp.com/) which indexes [encoded bibliographic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_standards), and provides a minimal [discovery interface](https://blog.andornot.com/blog/discovery-interfaces-a-new-opac-for-libraries/) with hierarchical facets.
* This [project](https://rest-countries-challenge.herokuapp.com/) was a front-end challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca), in which I've used TailwindCSS and Hotwire to build responsive and progressively enhanced views.

### I'm familiar with...
* Modeling and processing semi-structured data in Rails.
* Faceted navigation
* TailwindCSS, Hotwire, Elasticsearch, Docker

### I like...
* Designing domain models.
* Writing code that reads well.
* Finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

### But I also like...
* Playing video games (Especially fighting games and FPS).
* Playing chess for time to time.
* Watching Netflix. (I recommend "Queen's Gambit" by the way!)
* Jiujitsu (though I can't practice it at the moment)
