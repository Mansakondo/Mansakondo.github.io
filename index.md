## Rails Developer / Ruby Programmer

### Hi, I'm Mansa Keïta
* I'm a self-taught developer.
* I'm 23.
* I live in France (UTC+1/2).

### In the last 3 years...
* I dropped out of college.
* I taught myself programming and web development.
* I worked as a volunteer in a library, where I animated sessions to teach kids how to
		code.

### During my self-learning, I worked on...
* A [PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43399) (extracted from a [gem](https://github.com/mansakondo/activemodel-embedding)) to model semi-structured data in Rails.
* A [gem](https://github.com/mansakondo/parallelixir) which delegates Ruby background processing to Elixir.
* An [application](https://karan-demo.herokuapp.com/) which indexes [encoded bibliographic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_standards), and provides a minimal [discovery interface](https://blog.andornot.com/blog/discovery-interfaces-a-new-opac-for-libraries/) with hierarchical facets.
* A front-end [challenge](https://rest-countries-challenge.herokuapp.com/) from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca), with responsive and progressively enhanced views made with TailwindCSS and Hotwire.

### Now I'm familiar with...
* How HTTP works.
* Languages like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and a bit of Erlang/Elixir.
* Databases like PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch.
* How to manage, share and deploy code with tools like Git, Heroku, Docker.

### When I'm writing software, I care about...
* Designing relevant domain models.
* Writing code that reads well.
* Finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

### When I'm not writing software, I enjoy...
* Playing video games (Especially fighting games and FPS).
* Playing chess from time to time.
* Watching Jiujitsu videos and Netflix. (I recommend "Queen's Gambit" by the way!)
